## Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) System
This repository implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system, a powerful approach that combines the capabilities of information retrieval with generative AI models. 
The RAG system retrieves relevant documents from a knowledge base and uses them to augment the responses generated by a language model, enhancing the accuracy, specificity, and contextual relevance of outputs.
The knowledge base comprises pdf documents on health topics. We extract both text and images that we use for retrieval.
We use the following LLMs: GPT-3.5 turbo, GPT-4, GPT-4-vision-preview. Pinecone is the vector DB being used.
